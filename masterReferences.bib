  abstract = {The slower wind speeds and increased turbulence that are characteristic of turbine wakes have considerable consequences on large wind farms: turbines located downwind generate less power and experience increased turbulent loads. The structures of wakes and their downwind impacts are sensitive to wind speed and atmospheric variability. Wake characterization can provide important insights for turbine layout optimization in view of decreasing the cost of wind energy. The CWEX-13 field campaign, which took place between June and September 2013 in a wind farm in Iowa, was designed to explore the interaction of multiple wakes in a range of atmospheric stability conditions. Based on lidar wind measurements, we extend, present, and apply a quantitative algorithm to assess wake parameters such as the velocity deficits, the size of the wake boundaries, and the location of the wake centerlines. We focus on wakes from a row of four turbines at the leading edge of the wind farm to explore variations between wakes from the edge of the row (outer wakes) and those from turbines in the center of the row (inner wakes). Using multiple horizontal scans at different elevations, a three-dimensional structure of wakes from the row of turbines can be created. Wakes erode very quickly during unstable conditions, and can in fact be detected primarily in stable conditions in the conditions measured here. During stable conditions, important differences emerge between the wakes of inner turbines and the wakes of outer turbines. Further, the strong wind veer associated with stable conditions results in a stretching of the wake structures, and this stretching manifests differently for inner and outer wakes. These insights can be incorporated into low-order wake models for wind farm layout optimization or for wind power forecasting.},

  abstract = {In this study, horizontally periodic large eddy simulations (LES) are utilized to study turbulent atmospheric boundary-layer flow over wind turbines in the far-downstream portion of a large wind farm where the wakes have merged and the flow is fully developed. In an attempt to increase power generation by enhancing the mean kinetic energy (MKE) entrainment to the wind turbines, hypothetical synthetic forcing is applied to the flow at the turbine rotor locations. The synthetic forcing is not meant to represent any existing devices or control schemes, but rather acts as a proof of concept to inform future designs. The turbines are modeled using traditional actuator disks, and the unconventional synthetic forcing is applied in the vertical direction with the magnitude and direction dependent on the instantaneous velocity fluctuation at the rotor disk; in one set of LES meant to enhance the vertical entrainment of MKE, a downward force is prescribed in conjunction with a positive axial velocity fluctuation, whereas a negative axial velocity fluctuation results in an upward force. The magnitude of the forcing is proportional to the instantaneous thrust force with prefactors ranging from 0.1 to 1. The synthetic vertical forcing is found to have a significant effect on the power generated by the wind farm. Consistent with previous findings, the MKE flux to the level of the turbines is found to vary along with the total power produced by the wind turbine array. The reverse strategy of downward forcing of slow axial velocity flow is found to have almost no effect on the power output or entrainment. Several of the scenarios tested, e.g., where the vertical force is of similar magnitude to the horizontal thrust, would be very difficult to implement in practice, but the simulations serve the purpose of identifying trends and bounds on possible power increases from flow modifications through action at the turbine rotor.},

Efficient detection of wind turbines operating below their expected power output and immediate corrections help maximise asset value. The presented method estimates the environmental conditions from turbine states and uses pre-calculated power matrices from a numeric wake model to predict the expected power output. Deviations between the expected and the measured power output are an indication of underperformance. The confidence of detected underperformance is estimated by detailed analysis of uncertainties of the method. Power normalisation with reference turbines and averaging several measurement devices can reduce uncertainties for estimating the expected power. A demonstration of the method's ability to detect underperformance in the form of degradation and curtailment is given. Underperformance of 8 \% could be detected in a triple wake condition.},

  abstract     = {Wake effects within wind farms can significantly decrease the power production and increase the cost of electricity. Herein, we designed a wake steering control scheme to increase the power production of wind farms. The wake steering method was tested in an array of six utility-scale turbines where it increased the power production for wind speeds near the site annual average between 7\% and 13\% and decreased variability by up to 72\%, for selected wind directions at night. These improvements can contribute to the increasing ability of wind farms to provide reliable, low-cost, and efficient base energy load.Global power production increasingly relies on wind farms to supply low-carbon energy. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report predicted that renewable energy production must leap from 20\% of the global energy mix in 2018 to 67\% by 2050 to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5{\textdegree}C above preindustrial levels. This increase requires reliable, low-cost energy production. However, wind turbines are often placed in close proximity within wind farms due to land and transmission line constraints, which results in wind farm efficiency degradation of up to 40\% for wind directions aligned with columns of turbines. To increase wind farm power production, we developed a wake steering control scheme. This approach maximizes the power of a wind farm through yaw misalignment that deflects wakes away from downstream turbines. Optimization was performed with site-specific analytic gradient ascent relying on historical operational data. The protocol was tested in an operational wind farm in Alberta, Canada, resulting in statistically significant (P\&lt;0.05) power increases of 7{\textendash}13\% for wind speeds near the site average and wind directions which occur during less than 10\% of nocturnal operation and 28{\textendash}47\% for low wind speeds in the same wind directions. Wake steering also decreased the variability in the power production of the wind farm by up to 72\%. Although the resulting gains in annual energy production were insignificant at this farm, these statistically significant wake steering results demonstrate the potential to increase the efficiency and predictability of power production through the reduction of wake losses.},

  abstract       = {Wind farms experience significant efficiency losses due to the aerodynamic interaction between turbines. A possible control technique to minimize these losses is yaw-based wake steering. This paper investigates the potential for improved performance of the Lillgrund wind farm through a detailed calibration of a low-fidelity engineering model aimed specifically at yaw-based wake steering. The importance of each model parameter is assessed through a sensitivity analysis. This work shows that the model is overparameterized as at least one model parameter can be excluded from the calibration. The performance of the calibrated model is tested through an uncertainty analysis, which showed that the model has a significant bias but low uncertainty when comparing the predicted wake losses with measured wake losses. The model is used to optimize the annual energy production of the Lillgrund wind farm by determining yaw angles for specific inflow conditions. A significant energy gain is found when the optimal yaw angles are calculated deterministically. However, the energy gain decreases drastically when uncertainty in input conditions is included. More robust yaw angles can be obtained when the input uncertainty is taken into account during the optimization, which yields an energy gain of approximately 3.4%.},
